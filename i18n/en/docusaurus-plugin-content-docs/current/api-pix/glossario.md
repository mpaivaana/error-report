## location

A location is a URL of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/" target="_blank">capability URL</a> type that serves as **address for a charge**. In other words, it is through a location that it is possible to retrieve information related to a charge and, thus, carry out the transactions.

## payload

Payload is the name given to the second fragment of the JWS object(JSON Web Signature) that contains a JSON with data related to a charge.

## revis√£o

The "revisao" field records the number of changes to a charge. A new charge always starts with revision value of 0 (zero),and this value is incremented one unit whenever the charge changes, except when the change is the Location.

## txid

Each Pix transaction has a **Transaction Identifier**, called <code>txid</code>, which in the context of representing a charge, is unique per CPF/CNPJ of the receiving user. A <code>txid</code> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric" target="_blank">alphanumeric string</a> with a minimum length of 26 and a maximum of 35 characters. A valid txid therefore, must obey the following regular expression (regex): <code>^[a-zA-Z0-9]{26,35}$</code>. You can to validate txid strings under the regex <a href="https://regex101.com/r/iZ08y4/1" target="_blank">here</a>.

## webhook

Name of the functionality in which it is possible to register a callback URL to receive notifications about updates of transactions involving a certain Dict key.
