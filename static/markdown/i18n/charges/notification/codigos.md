<br/>
Internal server error. The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This usually indicates a web server error. A common cause is an error in the <code>.htaccess</code> file. To investigate, read your server's error log.<br/><br/>
It's worth noting that this type of error is not accessible by PHP, so you will not be able to read the log details by enabling PHP error display.<br/><br/>
However, not always the error is from the webserver, as it is possible to configure the environment so that errors from PHP or another module, for example, are handled by the webserver with status 500.
